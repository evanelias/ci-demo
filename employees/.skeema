# Example of how to use different schema names based on environment name
# e.g. `skeema diff development` --> schema name of employees_dev
#
# If no environment is specified, e.g. `skeema diff`, the default is production.
# (The CI system also uses production, but schema names are irrelevant there.)

# Top-level config applies to all environments (but can optionally be overridden
# in specific environments)
default-character-set=latin1
default-collation=latin1_swedish_ci

# Configuration applying to production environment
[production]
schema=employees_prod

# Configuration applying to staging environment
[staging]
schema=employees_stage

# Configuration applying to development environment
[development]
schema=employees_dev
